## Logical errors and how you handled them
Some logical errors were avoided before they cropped up through the use of pair programming, and reviewing line by line.

 - Logical Error 1: Messy skeleton code

   The provided skeleton code had multiple spacing, output, log output, log name, ... provided in it. I will list the changes made here, none make any impact other than making outputs readable:

   - avoided printing duplicating information when read from a file.
   - fixed openlog() so logfilename is printed correctly.
   - changed spacing of print statements such that data relating to one operation is grouped together. (removing duplicate \n)
   - changed the order of functions in zgt_tx to make the code more readable and to outline our work
   - made commit print out correct transaction id. Only effected print, not execution

   As a last bit of complaint about the skeleton code. It is not C++, it is a C/C++ amalgamation.
